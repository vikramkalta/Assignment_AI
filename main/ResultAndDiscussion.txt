In this paper a couple of machine learning algorithms were applied
to fashion-MNIST dataset. The maximum accuracy which was achieved was
{80%} with decision tree classifier model. The time complexity for k-NN
was O(n*log(n)*m + k), where n is the total training dataset samples,
n * log (n) is the time taken for sorting the training dataset which can
be done using quick sort or merge sort like algorithms having worst case
n*log (n) time complexity; m is the training dataset sample count; and finally
k is the value of k selected. Overall it makes it a really expensive operation.
In the [5] as discussed above the time complexity can be further brought down
by pre calculating the distances between each of test and training samples
and storing them, this increases time space complexity.
