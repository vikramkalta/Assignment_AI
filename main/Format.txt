The format for writing an AI-based assignment for postgraduate study
in a UK university will generally follow the same structure as any
other academic assignment. This typically includes an introduction,
literature review, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion, and
references.

In the introduction, you should provide an overview of the topic you
are addressing and explain the purpose of the assignment. You should
also outline the research questions or objectives that you aim to address.

The literature review should provide a summary of the existing research
on the topic, highlighting any relevant theories, models, or methods that
have been used in the past. This will help to contextualize your work and
demonstrate how your research contributes to the existing body of knowledge.

The methodology section should describe the research design and methods
you used to conduct your study. This should include details on the data
collection and analysis techniques you employed, as well as any ethical
considerations that you took into account.

In the results section, you should present the findings of your study,
including any statistical analyses or other relevant data. You should
also provide an interpretation of these results and discuss any implications
for your research questions or objectives.

The discussion section should provide a more in-depth analysis of your results,
drawing on the literature review to contextualize your findings and discuss
their implications for the field. You should also consider any limitations of
your study and suggest directions for future research.

The conclusion should summarize the main points of your assignment and provide a
final evaluation of your research. It should also highlight the contributions that
your work has made to the field.

Finally, the reference list should include all the sources that you have cited
in your assignment, following the appropriate citation style (such as APA,
Harvard, or Chicago).
