An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics)
Suppose that we would like to estimate the test error associated with fitting a particular statistical
learning method on a set of observations. The validation set approach […] is a very simple strategy for
this task. It involves randomly dividing the available set of observations into two parts, a training set
and a validation set or hold-out set. The model is fit on the training set, and the fitted model is used
to predict the responses for the observations in the validation set. The resulting validation set error
rate — typically assessed using MSE in the case of a quantitative response—provides an estimate of the test error rate.
